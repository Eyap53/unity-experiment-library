A library to easily build experiment applications, and manage the inputs and outputs files in a standardized and clever way.

## Adding the Package

That package needs the CsvHelper library to work.
For that, you need to add the UnityNuget scope registry if you did not already.
See : `https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet`.

Then, this package can be added using open UPM. See : `https://openupm.com/packages/com.maellacour.experiment-library`
